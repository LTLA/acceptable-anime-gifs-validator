# Format the acceptable anime GIF database

This repository contains code to format the [acceptable anime GIF](https://github.com/LTLA/acceptable-anime-gifs) database.
The aim is to easily collate the GIF metadata into a single set of manifests for easy consumption by REST services.
The formatter is written in Go and can be compiled with the usual `go build .`.
